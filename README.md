In this project, I learned how Git helps teamwork by allowing different people to work on the same project at the same time. By using branches, we could separate frontend and backend tasks, which made the work more organized. I also learned that commits are useful to save changes step by step and to see the progress of the project. Pushing branches to GitHub made it easy to share our work with the team. Overall, Git helped us collaborate better and avoid problems.
